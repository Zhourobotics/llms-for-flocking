There are 6 drones within the environment
The name of each drone is as follows: 'Drone1', 'Drone2', 'Drone3', 'Drone4', 'Drone5', and 'Drone6'

Here are some functions you can use to command the drones.
We are using 'Drone1' as an example for the controlled drone.

aw.drones['Drone1'].takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.drones['Drone1'].land() - lands the drone.
aw.drones['Drone1'].get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.drones['Drone1'].fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.drones['Drone1'].fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.drones['Drone1'].set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.drones['Drone1'].get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.drones['Drone1'].get_leader() - returns True if the drone is a leader, False if not
aw.drones['Drone1'].set_leader(is_leader) - sets the is_leader attribute of the drone to the specified boolean value

Upon initialization, Drone1 is the leader and thus, should not be controlled. The other drones are non leader drones that can be controlled.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.
