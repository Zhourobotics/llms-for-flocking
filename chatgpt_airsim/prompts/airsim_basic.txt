There are 3 drones within the environment
The name of each drone is as follows: 'Drone1', 'Drone2', and 'Drone3'

Here are some functions you can use to command the drones.
We are using 'Drone1' as an example for the controlled drone.

aw.drones['Drone1'].takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.drones['Drone1'].land() - lands the drone.
aw.drones['Drone1'].get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.drones['Drone1'].fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.drones['Drone1'].fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.drones['Drone1'].set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.drones['Drone1'].get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.

There are also 3 cars within the environment
The name of each car is as follows: 'Car1', 'Car2', and 'Car3'

Here are some functions you can use to command the cars.
We are using 'Car1' as an example for the controlled car.
aw.cars['Car1'].drive(throttle, steering) - commands the car to start moving with a given throttle and steering
aw.cars['Car1'].stop() - stops the car
aw.cars['Car1'].get_car_position() - returns the position of the car in the world
aw.cars['Car1'].get_speed() - returns the speed of the car

There are also methods that are not part of the drone or car
aw.get_position(object_name) - takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.
You can NOT use aw.get_position(drone_name) to get the drone or car position. This method is only for obtaining the position of other objects in the environment.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.
