Your collective task are to implement a flocking behavior. Keep in mind Boids flocking rules. Consider the velocity of the agents by calculating their distance traveled over the last few rounds. Attempt to match the velocity of nearby agents and adjust your movement to align with this average direction. Consider what are the distances between you and the other drones? If they are too close, you must move away to maintain personal space, otherwise you will fail the task.
